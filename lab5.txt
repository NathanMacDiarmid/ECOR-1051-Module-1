==========

Exercise 1: Single or Double Quotes - Does it matter?

Example, "haven't" or '"Spam, spam, spam," he said.'

>>> type('Hello')

String class

>>> type("goodbye")

String class

>>> 'This is a string'

'This is a string'

>>> ""     (An empty string - type two quotes with no spaces between them.)

''

>>> '"Spam, spam, spam," he said.'

'"Spam, spam, spam," he said.'

>>> "I haven't a clue" 

"I haven't a clue"

>>> 'I haven't a clue' 

Syntax Error

Concluding Questions: Generally, either double or single quotes works well but can you give a scenario where one is better than the other?

When there is an apostrophe in the string that you are typing, because it is another command within Python.

==================

Exercise 2: What operations are permitted with values of type str?

When used with strings, + is the concatenation operator. 

>>> 'Hello, ' + 'world!'

'Hello, world!'

When used with strings, * is the replication operator.

>>> "Spam" * 3

'SpamSpamSpam'

>>> 3 * "Spam"

'SpamSpamSpam'

>>> "Spam" * 0

''

>>> "Spam" * -3

''

There are other operators to try now: - and /

>>> "Hello" - "He"

Typer Error, unsupported, doesn't work.

>>> 'Spam' / 3

Type Error, unsupported, doesn't work.


Concluding Questions: What operators work with strings?  Does the order of operands matter?

Only operators that increase the character count inside the string will work. As well, if you use a number that is x<=0, it will just give back an empty string. No, the order does not matter.

=======================

Exercise 3 : Understand the string representation

Is  the string '123' the same as the integer 123? 

>>> '123' + 456

Type Error, can only addition either two int or two strings, but not one of each.

>>> '123' + '456'

123456

Concluding Question: When a string looks like a number, is it a number or a string?

It is a string and can't be added to a number.
